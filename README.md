# Data Structures Project
A project on Data Structures. An implementation of usual search algorithms, AVL trees, and hash tables.
The whole project is implemented with C++.
At first we collect data from ocean.csv file, which contains measurements of the temperature (in Â°C) of the ocean water and the recordings of Phosphate, Nitrite, Nitrate, Salinity, Oxygen for the period 2000 to 2015.
The purpose of the project is creating data structures with these data and execute usual algorithms on that structures
